{% popover Pulsar %} is a multi-tenant, high-performance solution for server-to-server messaging originally developed by [Yahoo](http://yahoo.github.io/) and now under the stewardship of the [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/).

Pulsar's key features include:

* Native support for multiple {% popover clusters %} in a Pulsar {% popover instance %}, with seamless [geo-replication](../../admin/GeoReplication) of messages across clusters
* Very low publish and end-to-end latency
* Seamless scalability out to over a million topics
* A simple [client API](#client-api) with bindings for [Java](../../clients/Java), [Python](../../clients/Python), and [C++](../../clients/Cpp)
* Multiple [subscription modes](#subscription-modes) for {% popover topics %} ([exclusive](#exclusive), [shared](#shared), and [failover](#failover))
* Guaranteed message delivery with [persistent message storage](#persistent-storage) provided by [Apache BookKeeper](http://bookkeeper.apache.org/)

## Producers, consumers, topics, and subscriptions

Pulsar is built on the [publish-subscribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) pattern, aka {% popover pub-sub %}. In this pattern, [producers](#producers) publish messages to [topics](#topics). [Consumers](#consumers) can then [subscribe](#subscription-modes) to those topics, process incoming messages, and send an {% popover acknowledgement %} when processing is complete.

Once a {% popover subscription %} has been created, all messages will be [retained](#persistent-storage) by Pulsar, even if the consumer gets disconnected. Retained messages will be discarded only when a consumer {% popover acknowledges %} that they've been successfully processed.

### Producers

A producer is a process that attaches to a topic and publishes messages to a Pulsar {% popover broker %} for processing.

#### Send modes

Producers can send messages to brokers either synchronously (sync) or asynchronously (async).

| Mode       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|:-----------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sync send  | The producer will wait for acknowledgement from the broker after sending each message. If acknowledgment isn't received then the producer will consider the send operation a failure.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Async send | The producer will put the message in a blocking queue and return immediately. The client library will then send the message to the broker in the background. If the queue is full (max size [configurable](../../reference/Configuration#broker), the producer could be blocked or fail immediately when calling the API, depending on arguments passed to the producer. |

#### Compression

Messages published by producers can be compressed during transportation in order to save bandwidth. Pulsar currently supports two types of compression:

* [LZ4](https://github.com/lz4/lz4)
* [ZLIB](https://zlib.net/)

#### Batching

If batching is enabled, the producer will accumulate and send a batch of messages in a single request. Batching size is defined by the maximum number of messages and maximum publish latency.

### Consumers

A consumer is a process that attaches to a topic via a subscription and then receives messages.

#### Receive modes

Messages can be received from {% popover brokers %} either synchronously (sync) or asynchronously (async).

| Mode          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|:--------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sync receive  | A sync receive will be blocked until a message is available.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Async receive | An async receive will return immediately with a future value---a [`CompletableFuture`](http://www.baeldung.com/java-completablefuture) in Java, for example---that completes once a new message is available. |

#### Acknowledgement

When a consumer has successfully processed a message, it needs to send an {% popover acknowledgement %} to the broker so that the broker can discard the message (otherwise it [stores](#persistent-storage) the message).

Messages can be acknowledged either one by one or cumulatively. With cumulative acknowledgement, the consumer only needs to acknowledge the last message it received. All messages in the stream up to (and including) the provided message will not be re-delivered to that consumer.

{% include admonition.html type='warning' content='Cumulative acknowledgement cannot be used with [shared subscription mode](#subscription-modes), because shared mode involves multiple consumers having access to the same subscription.' %}

#### Listeners

Client libraries can provide their own listener implementations for consumers. The [Java client](../../clients/Java), for example, provides a {% javadoc MesssageListener client org.apache.pulsar.client.api.MessageListener %} interface. In this interface, the `received` method is called whenever a new message is received.

### Topics

As in other pub-sub systems, topics in Pulsar are named channels for transmitting messages from {% popover producers %} to {% popover consumers %}. Topic names are URLs that have a well-defined structure:

{% include topic.html type="{persistent|non-persistent}" ten="tenant" n="namespace" t="topic" %}

Topic name component | Description
:--------------------|:-----------
`persistent` / `non-persistent` | This identifies the type of topic. Pulsar supports two kind of topics: [persistent](#persistent-storage) and [non-persistent](#non-persistent-topics) (persistent is the default, so if you don't specify a type the topic will be persistent). With persistent topics, all messages are durably [persisted](#persistent-storage) on disk (that means on multiple disks unless the {% popover broker %} is {% popover standalone %}), whereas data for [non-persistent](#non-persistent-topics) topics isn't persisted to storage disks.
`tenant`             | The topic's {% popover tenant %} within the instance. Tenants are essential to {% popover multi-tenancy %} in Pulsar and can be spread across clusters.
`namespace`          | The administrative unit of the topic, which acts as a grouping mechanism for related topics. Most topic configuration is performed at the [namespace](#namespace) level. Each tenant can have multiple namespaces.
`topic`              | The final part of the name. Topic names are freeform and have no special meaning in a Pulsar instance.

{% include admonition.html type="success" title="No need to explicitly create new topics"
content="You don't need to explicitly create topics in Pulsar. If a client attempts to write or receive messages to/from a topic that does not yet exist, Pulsar will automatically create that topic under the [namespace](#namespace) provided in the [topic name](#topics)." %}

### Namespaces

A namespace is a logical nomenclature within a tenant. A tenant can create multiple namespaces via the [admin API](../../admin-api/namespaces#create). For instance, a tenant with different applications can create a separate namespace for each application. A namespace allows the application to create and manage a hierarchy of topics. The topic `my-tenant/app1` is a namespace for the application `app1` for `my-tenant`. You can create any number of [topics](#topics) under the namespace.

### Subscription modes

A subscription is a named configuration rule that determines how messages are delivered to {% popover consumers %}. There are three available subscription modes in Pulsar: [exclusive](#exclusive), [shared](#shared), and [failover](#failover). These modes are illustrated in the figure below.

{% include figure.html src="/img/pulsar-subscription-modes.png" alt="Subscription modes" width="80" %}

#### Exclusive

In *exclusive* mode, only a single consumer is allowed to attach to the subscription. If more than one consumer attempts to subscribe to a topic using the same subscription, the consumer receives an error.

In the diagram above, only **Consumer-A** is allowed to consume messages.

{% include admonition.html type="info" content="Exclusive mode is the default subscription mode." %}

{% include figure.html src="/img/exclusive-subscriptions.png" alt="Exclusive subscriptions" width="80" %}

#### Shared

In *shared* or *round robin* mode, multiple consumers can attach to the same subscription. Messages are delivered in a round robin distribution across consumers, and any given message is delivered to only one consumer. When a consumer disconnects, all the messages that were sent to it and not acknowledged will be rescheduled for sending to the remaining consumers.

In the diagram above, **Consumer-B-1** and **Consumer-B-2** are able to subscribe to the topic, but **Consumer-C-1** and others could as well.

{% include message.html id="shared_mode_limitations" %}

{% include figure.html src="/img/shared-subscriptions.png" alt="Shared subscriptions" width="80" %}

#### Failover

In *failover* mode, multiple consumers can attach to the same subscription. The consumers will be lexically sorted by the consumer's name and the first consumer will initially be the only one receiving messages. This consumer is called the *master consumer*.

When the master consumer disconnects, all (non-acked and subsequent) messages will be delivered to the next consumer in line.

In the diagram above, Consumer-C-1 is the master consumer while Consumer-C-2 would be the next in line to receive messages if Consumer-C-2 disconnected.

{% include figure.html src="/img/failover-subscriptions.png" alt="Shared subscriptions" width="80" %}

### Multi-topic subscriptions

When a {% popover consumer %} subscribes to a Pulsar {% popover topic %}, by default it subscribes to one specific topic, such as `persistent://sample/ns1/standalone/my-topic`. As of Pulsar version 1.23.0-incubating, however, Pulsar consumers can simultaneously subscribe to multiple topics. You can define a list of topics in two ways:

* On the basis of a [**reg**ular **ex**pression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) (regex), for example `persistent://sample/standalone/ns1/finance-.*`
* By explicitly defining a list of topics

{% include admonition.html type="info" content="When subscribing to multiple topics by regex, all topics must be in the same [namespace](#namespaces)." %}

When subscribing to multiple topics, the Pulsar client will automatically make a call to the Pulsar API to discover the topics that match the regex pattern/list and then subscribe to all of them. If any of the topics don't currently exist, the consumer will auto-subscribe to them once the topics are created.

{% include admonition.html type="danger" title="No ordering guarantees"
   content="When a consumer subscribes to multiple topics, all ordering guarantees normally provided by Pulsar on single topics do not hold. If your use case for Pulsar involves any strict ordering requirements, we would strongly recommend against using this feature." %}

Here are some multi-topic subscription examples for Java:

```java
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

import org.apache.pulsar.client.api.Consumer;
import org.apache.pulsar.client.api.PulsarClient;

PulsarClient pulsarClient = // Instantiate Pulsar client object

// Subscribe to all topics in a namespace
Pattern allTopicsInNamespace = Pattern.compile("persistent://sample/standalone/ns1/.*");
Consumer allTopicsConsumer = pulsarClient.subscribe(allTopicsInNamespace, "subscription-1");

// Subscribe to a subsets of topics in a namespace, based on regex
Pattern someTopicsInNamespace = Pattern.compile("persistent://sample/standalone/ns1/foo.*");
Consumer someTopicsConsumer = pulsarClient.subscribe(someTopicsInNamespace, "subscription-1");
```

For code examples, see:

* [Java](../../clients/Java#multi-topic-subscriptions)

### Partitioned topics

{% include explanations/partitioned-topics.md %}

### Non-persistent topics

{% include explanations/non-persistent-topics.md %}

{% include admonition.html type="success" content='For more info on using non-persistent topics, see the [Non-persistent messaging cookbook](../../cookbooks/non-persistent-topics).' %}

In non-persistent topics, {% popover brokers %} immediately deliver messages to all connected subscribers *without persisting them* in [BookKeeper](#persistent-storage). If a subscriber is disconnected, the broker will not be able to deliver those in-transit messages, and subscribers will never be able to receive those messages again. Eliminating the persistent storage step makes messaging on non-persistent topics slightly faster than on persistent topics in some cases, but with the caveat that some of the core benefits of Pulsar are lost.

{% include admonition.html type="danger" content="With non-persistent topics, message data lives only in memory. If a message broker fails or message data can otherwise not be retrieved from memory, your message data may be lost. Use non-persistent topics only if you're *certain* that your use case requires it and can sustain it." %}

By default, non-persistent topics are enabled on Pulsar {% popover brokers %}. You can disable them in the broker's [configuration](../../reference/Configuration#broker-enableNonPersistentTopics). You can manage non-persistent topics using the [`pulsar-admin non-persistent`](../../reference/CliTools#pulsar-admin-non-persistent) interface.

#### Performance

Non-persistent messaging is usually faster than persistent messaging because brokers don't persist messages and immediately send acks back to the producer as soon as that message is deliver to all connected subscribers. Producers thus see comparatively low publish latency with non-persistent topic.

#### Client API

Producers and consumers can connect to non-persistent topics in the same way as persistent topics, with the crucial difference that the topic name must start with `non-persistent`. All three subscription modes---[exclusive](#exclusive), [shared](#shared), and [failover](#failover)---are supported for non-persistent topics.

Here's an example [Java consumer](../../clients/Java#consumer) for a non-persistent topic:

```java
PulsarClient client = PulsarClient.create("pulsar://localhost:6650");
String npTopic = "non-persistent://sample/standalone/ns1/my-topic";
String subscriptionName = "my-subscription-name";

Consumer consumer = client.subscribe(npTopic, subscriptionName);
```

Here's an example [Java producer](../../clients/Java#producer) for the same non-persistent topic:

```java
Producer producer = client.createProducer(npTopic);
```

#### Broker configuration

Sometimes, there would be a need to configure few dedicated brokers in a cluster, to just serve non-persistent topics.

Broker configuration for enabling broker to own only configured type of topics  

```
# It disables broker to load persistent topics
enablePersistentTopics=false
# It enables broker to load non-persistent topics
enableNonPersistentTopics=true
```


## Architecture overview

At the highest level, a Pulsar {% popover instance %} is composed of one or more Pulsar {% popover clusters %}. Clusters within an instance can [replicate](#replicate) data amongst themselves.

In a Pulsar cluster:

* One or more {% popover brokers %} handles and load balances incoming messages from {% popover producers %}, dispatches messages to {% popover consumers %}, communicates with the Pulsar {% popover configuration store %} to handle various coordination tasks, stores messages in {% popover BookKeeper %} instances (aka {% popover bookies %}), relies on a cluster-specific {% popover ZooKeeper %} cluster for certain tasks, and more.
* A {% popover BookKeeper %} cluster consisting of one more or more {% popover bookies %} handles [persistent storage](#persistent-storage) of messages.
* A {% popover ZooKeeper %} cluster specific to that cluster handles

The diagram below provides an illustration of a Pulsar cluster:

{% include figure.html src="/img/pulsar-system-architecture.png" alt="Pulsar architecture diagram" width="90" %}

At the broader {% popover instance %} level, an instance-wide ZooKeeper cluster called the {% popover configuration store %} handles coordination tasks involving multiple clusters, for example [geo-replication](#replication).

## Brokers

The Pulsar message {% popover broker %} is a stateless component that's primarily responsible for running two other components:

* An HTTP server that exposes a REST API for both [administrative tasks](../../reference/RestApi) and [topic lookup](#client-setup-phase) for producers and consumers
* A {% popover dispatcher %}, which is an asynchronous TCP server over a custom [binary protocol](../../reference/BinaryProtocol) used for all data transfers

Messages are typically dispatched out of a [managed ledger](#managed-ledger) cache for the sake of performance, *unless* the backlog exceeds the cache size. If the backlog grows too large for the cache, the broker will start reading entries from {% popover BookKeeper %}.

Finally, to support {% popover geo-replication %} on global topics, the broker manages replicators that tail the entries published in the local region and republish them to the remote region using the Pulsar [Java client library](../../clients/Java).

{% include admonition.html type="info" content="For a guide to managing Pulsar brokers, see the [Clusters and brokers](../../admin/ClustersBrokers#managing-brokers) guide." %}

## Clusters

A Pulsar {% popover instance %} consists of one or more Pulsar *clusters*. Clusters, in turn, consist of:

* One or more Pulsar [brokers](#broker)
* A {% popover ZooKeeper %} quorum used for cluster-level configuration and coordination
* An ensemble of {% popover bookies %} used for [persistent storage](#persistent-storage) of messages

Clusters can replicate amongst themselves using [geo-replication](#geo-replication).

{% include admonition.html type="info" content="For a guide to managing Pulsar clusters, see the [Clusters and brokers](../../admin/ClustersBrokers#managing-clusters) guide." %}

## Metadata store

Pulsar uses [Apache Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) for metadata storage, cluster configuration, and coordination. In a Pulsar instance:

* A {% popover configuration store %} quorum stores configuration for {% popover tenants %}, {% popover namespaces %}, and other entities that need to be globally consistent.
* Each cluster has its own local ZooKeeper ensemble that stores {% popover cluster %}-specific configuration and coordination such as ownership metadata, broker load reports, BookKeeper {% popover ledger %} metadata, and more.

## Persistent storage

Pulsar provides guaranteed message delivery for applications. If a message successfully reaches a Pulsar {% popover broker %}, it will be delivered to its intended target.

This guarantee requires that non-{% popover acknowledged %} messages are stored in a durable manner until they can be delivered to and acknowledged by {% popover consumers %}. This mode of messaging is commonly called *persistent messaging*. In Pulsar, N copies of all messages are stored and synced on disk, for example 4 copies across two servers with mirrored [RAID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID) volumes on each server.

### Apache BookKeeper {#bookkeeper}

Pulsar uses a system called [Apache BookKeeper](http://bookkeeper.apache.org/) for persistent message storage. BookKeeper is a distributed [write-ahead log](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-ahead_logging) (WAL) system that provides a number of crucial advantages for Pulsar:

* It enables Pulsar to utilize many independent logs, called [ledgers](#ledgers). Multiple ledgers can be created for {% popover topics %} over time.
* It offers very efficient storage for sequential data that handles entry replication.
* It guarantees read consistency of ledgers in the presence of various system failures.
* It offers even distribution of I/O across bookies.
* It's horizontally scalable in both capacity and throughput. Capacity can be immediately increased by adding more {% popover bookies %} to a cluster.
* {% popover Bookies %} are designed to handle thousands of ledgers with concurrent reads and writes. By using multiple disk devices---one for journal and another for general storage--bookies are able to isolate the effects of read operations from the latency of ongoing write operations.

In addition to message data, *cursors* are also persistently stored in BookKeeper. Cursors are {% popover subscription %} positions for {% popover consumers %}. BookKeeper enables Pulsar to store consumer position in a scalable fashion.

At the moment, Pulsar only supports persistent message storage. This accounts for the `persistent` in all {% popover topic %} names. Here's an example:

{% include topic.html ten="my-property" n="my-namespace" t="my-topic" %}

{% include admonition.html type="success" content='Pulsar also supports ephemeral ([non-persistent](#non-persistent-topics)) message storage.' %}

You can see an illustration of how {% popover brokers %} and {% popover bookies %} interact in the diagram below:

{% include figure.html src="/img/broker-bookie.png" alt="Brokers and bookies" width="80" %}

### Ledgers

A {% popover ledger %} is an append-only data structure with a single writer that is assigned to multiple BookKeeper storage nodes, or {% popover bookies %}. Ledger entries are replicated to multiple bookies. Ledgers themselves have very simple semantics:

* A Pulsar broker can create a ledger, append entries to the ledger, and close the ledger.
* After the ledger has been closed---either explicitly or because the writer process crashed---it can then be opened only in read-only mode.
* Finally, when entries in the ledger are no longer needed, the whole ledger can be deleted from the system (across all bookies).

#### Ledger read consistency

The main strength of Bookkeeper is that it guarantees read consistency in ledgers in the presence of failures. Since the ledger can only be written to by a single process, that process is free to append entries very efficiently, without need to obtain consensus. After a failure, the ledger will go through a recovery process that will finalize the state of the ledger and establish which entry was last committed to the log. After that point, all readers of the ledger are guaranteed to see the exact same content.

#### Managed ledgers

Given that Bookkeeper ledgers provide a single log abstraction, a library was developed on top of the ledger called the *managed ledger* that represents the storage layer for a single topic. A managed ledger represents the abstraction of a stream of messages with a single writer that keeps appending at the end of the stream and multiple {% popover cursors %} that are consuming the stream, each with its own associated position.

Internally, a single managed ledger uses multiple BookKeeper ledgers to store the data. There are two reasons to have multiple ledgers:

1. After a failure, a ledger is no longer writable and a new one needs to be created.
2. A ledger can be deleted when all cursors have consumed the messages it contains. This allows for periodic rollover of ledgers.

### Journal storage

In BookKeeper, *journal* files contain BookKeeper transaction logs. Before making an update to a [ledger](#ledgers), a bookie needs to ensure that a transaction describing the update is written to persistent (non-volatile) storage. A new journal file is created once the bookie starts or the older journal file reaches the journal file size threshold (configured using the [`journalMaxSizeMB`](../../reference/Configuration#bookkeeper-journalMaxSizeMB) parameter).

### Non-persistent storage

A future version of BookKeeper will support *non-persistent messaging* and thus multiple durability modes at the topic level. This will enable you to set the durability mode at the topic level, replacing the `persistent` in topic names with a `non-persistent` indicator.

## Message retention and expiry

By default, Pulsar message {% popover brokers %}:

* immediately delete *all* messages that have been {% popover acknowledged %} by a {% popover consumer %}, and
* [persistently store](#persistent-storage) all unacknowledged messages in a message backlog.

Pulsar has two features, however, that enable you to override this default behavior:

* Message **retention** enables you to store messages that have been acknowledged by a consumer
* Message **expiry** enables you to set a time to live (TTL) for messages that have not yet been acknowledged

{% include admonition.html type="info" content='All message retention and expiry is managed at the [namespace](#namespaces) level. For a how-to, see the [Message retention and expiry](../../cookbooks/RetentionExpiry) cookbook.' %}

The diagram below illustrates both concepts:

{% include figure.html src="/img/retention-expiry.png" alt="Message retention and expiry" width="80" %}

With message retention, shown at the top, a <span style="color: #89b557;">retention policy</span> applied to all topics in a {% popover namespace %} dicates that some messages are durably stored in Pulsar even though they've already been acknowledged. Acknowledged messages that are not covered by the retention policy are <span style="color: #bb3b3e;">deleted</span>. Without a retention policy, *all* of the <span style="color: #19967d;">acknowledged messages</span> would be deleted.

With message expiry, shown at the bottom, some messages are <span style="color: #bb3b3e;">deleted</span>, even though they <span style="color: #337db6;">haven't been acknowledged</span>, because they've expired according to the <span style="color: #e39441;">TTL applied to the namespace</span> (for example because a TTL of 5 minutes has been applied and the messages haven't been acknowledged but are 10 minutes old).

## Pulsar Functions

For an in-depth look at Pulsar Functions, see the [Pulsar Functions overview](../../functions/overview).

## Replication

Pulsar enables messages to be produced and consumed in different geo-locations. For instance, your application may be publishing data in one region or market and you would like to process it for consumption in other regions or markets. [Geo-replication](../../admin/GeoReplication) in Pulsar enables you to do that.

## Message deduplication

Message **duplication** occurs when a message is [persisted](#persistent-storage) by Pulsar more than once. Message ***de*duplication** is an optional Pulsar feature that prevents unnecessary message duplication by processing each message only once, *even if the message is received more than once*.

The following diagram illustrates what happens when message deduplication is disabled vs. enabled:

{% include figure.html src="/img/message-deduplication.png" alt="Pulsar message deduplication" width="75" %}

Message deduplication is disabled in the scenario shown at the top. Here, a producer publishes message 1 on a topic; the message reaches a Pulsar {% popover broker %} and is [persisted](#persistent-storage) to BookKeeper. The producer then sends message 1 again (in this case due to some retry logic), and the message is received by the broker and stored in BookKeeper again, which means that duplication has occurred.

In the second scenario at the bottom, the producer publishes message 1, which is received by the broker and persisted, as in the first scenario. When the producer attempts to publish the message again, however, the broker knows that it has already seen message 1 and thus does not persist the message.

{% include admonition.html type="info" content='Message deduplication is handled at the namespace level. For more instructions, see the [message deduplication cookbook](../../cookbooks/message-deduplication).' %}

### Producer idempotency

The other available approach to message deduplication is to ensure that each message is *only produced once*. This approach is typically called **producer idempotency**. The drawback of this approach is that it defers the work of message deduplication to the application. In Pulsar, this is handled at the {% popover broker %} level, which means that you don't need to modify your Pulsar client code. Instead, you only need to make administrative changes (see the [Managing message deduplication](../../cookbooks/message-deduplication) cookbook for a guide).

### Deduplication and effectively-once semantics

Message deduplication makes Pulsar an ideal messaging system to be used in conjunction with stream processing engines (SPEs) and other systems seeking to provide [effectively-once](https://blog.streaml.io/exactly-once/) processing semantics. Messaging systems that don't offer automatic message deduplication require the SPE or other system to guarantee deduplication, which means that strict message ordering comes at the cost of burdening the application with the responsibility of deduplication. With Pulsar, strict ordering guarantees come at no application-level cost.

{% include admonition.html type="info" content='

## Multi-tenancy

Pulsar was created from the ground up as a {% popover multi-tenant %} system. To support multi-tenancy, Pulsar has a concept of {% popover tenants %}. Tenants can be spread across {% popover clusters %} and can each have their own [authentication and authorization](../../admin/Authz) scheme applied to them. They are also the administrative unit at which storage quotas, [message TTL](../../cookbooks/RetentionExpiry#time-to-live-ttl), and isolation policies can be managed.

The multi-tenant nature of Pulsar is reflected mostly visibly in topic URLs, which have this structure:

{% include topic.html ten="tenant" n="namespace" t="topic" %}

As you can see, the tenant is the most basic unit of categorization for topics (more fundamental than the {% popover namespace %} and topic name).

### Tenants and namespaces

{% include explanations/tenants-namespaces.md %}

## Authentication and Authorization

Pulsar supports a pluggable [authentication](../../admin/Authz) mechanism which can be configured at broker and it also supports authorization to identify client and its access rights on topics and tenants.

## Client interface

Pulsar exposes a client API with language bindings for [Java](../../clients/Java) and [C++](../../clients/Cpp). The client API optimizes and encapsulates Pulsar's client-broker communication protocol and exposes a simple and intuitive API for use by applications.

Under the hood, the current official Pulsar client libraries support transparent reconnection and/or connection failover to {% popover brokers %}, queuing of messages until {% popover acknowledged %} by the broker, and heuristics such as connection retries with backoff.

If you'd like to create your own client library, we recommend consulting the documentation on Pulsar's custom [binary protocol](../../project/BinaryProtocol).
" %}

### Client setup phase

When an application wants to create a producer/consumer, the Pulsar client library will initiate a setup phase that is composed of two steps:

1. The client will attempt to determine the owner of the topic by sending an HTTP lookup request to the {% popover broker %}. The request could reach one of the active brokers which, by looking at the (cached) zookeeper metadata will know who is serving the topic or, in case nobody is serving it, will try to assign it to the least loaded broker.
1. Once the client library has the broker address, it will create a TCP connection (or reuse an existing connection from the pool) and authenticate it. Within this connection, client and broker exchange binary commands from a custom protocol. At this point the client will send a command to create producer/consumer to the broker, which will comply after having validated the authorization policy.

Whenever the TCP connection breaks, the client will immediately re-initiate this setup phase and will keep trying with exponential backoff to re-establish the producer or consumer until the operation succeeds.

## Pulsar proxy

One way for Pulsar clients to interact with a Pulsar [cluster](#clusters) is by connecting to Pulsar message [brokers](#brokers) directly. In some cases, however, this kind of direct connection is either infeasible or undesirable because the client doesn't have direct access to broker addresses. If you're running Pulsar in a cloud environment or on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) or an analogous platform, for example, then direct client connections to brokers are likely not possible.

The **Pulsar proxy** provides a solution to this problem by acting as a single gateway for all of the brokers in a cluster. If you run the Pulsar proxy (which, again, is optional), all client connections with the Pulsar {% popover cluster %} will flow through the proxy rather than communicating with brokers.

{% include admonition.html type="success" content="For the sake of performance and fault tolerance, you can run as many instances of the Pulsar proxy as you'd like." %}

Architecturally, the Pulsar proxy gets all the information it requires from ZooKeeper. When starting the proxy on a machine, you only need to provide ZooKeeper connection strings for the cluster-specific and instance-wide {% popover configuration store %} clusters. Here's an example:

```bash
$ bin/pulsar proxy \
  --zookeeper-servers zk-0,zk-1,zk-2 \
  --configuration-store-servers zk-0,zk-1,zk-2
```

{% include admonition.html type="info" title="Pulsar proxy docs" content='

' %}

Some important things to know about the Pulsar proxy:

* Connecting clients don't need to provide *any* specific configuration to use the Pulsar proxy. You won't need to update the client configuration for existing applications beyond updating the IP used for the service URL (for example if you're running a load balancer over the Pulsar proxy).
* [TLS encryption and authentication](../../admin/Authz/#tls-client-auth) is supported by the Pulsar proxy

## Service discovery

[Clients](../../getting-started/Clients) connecting to Pulsar {% popover brokers %} need to be able to communicate with an entire Pulsar {% popover instance %} using a single URL. Pulsar provides a built-in service discovery mechanism that you can set up using the instructions in the [Deploying a Pulsar instance](../../deployment/InstanceSetup#service-discovery-setup) guide.

You can use your own service discovery system if you'd like. If you use your own system, there is just one requirement: when a client performs an HTTP request to an endpoint, such as `http://pulsar.us-west.example.com:8080`, the client needs to be redirected to *some* active broker in the desired {% popover cluster %}, whether via DNS, an HTTP or IP redirect, or some other means.

The diagram below illustrates Pulsar service discovery:

{% include figure.html src="/img/pulsar-service-discovery.png" width="50" %}

In this diagram, the Pulsar cluster is addressable via a single DNS name: `pulsar-cluster.acme.com`. A [Python client](../../clients/Python), for example, could access this Pulsar cluster like this:

```python
from pulsar import Client

client = Client('pulsar://pulsar-cluster.acme.com:6650')
```

## Reader interface

In Pulsar, the "standard" [consumer interface](#consumers) involves using {% popover consumers %} to listen on {% popover topics %}, process incoming messages, and finally {% popover acknowledge %} those messages when they've been processed. Whenever a consumer connects to a topic, it automatically begins reading from the earliest un-acked message onward because the topic's cursor is automatically managed by Pulsar.

The **reader interface** for Pulsar enables applications to manually manage cursors. When you use a reader to connect to a topic---rather than a consumer---you need to specify *which* message the reader begins reading from when it connects to a topic. When connecting to a topic, the reader interface enables you to begin with:

* The **earliest** available message in the topic
* The **latest** available message in the topic
* Some other message between the earliest and the latest. If you select this option, you'll need to explicitly provide a message ID. Your application will be responsible for "knowing" this message ID in advance, perhaps fetching it from a persistent data store or cache.

The reader interface is helpful for use cases like using Pulsar to provide [effectively-once](https://blog.streaml.io/exactly-once/) processing semantics for a stream processing system. For this use case, it's essential that the stream processing system be able to "rewind" topics to a specific message and begin reading there. The reader interface provides Pulsar clients with the low-level abstraction necessary to "manually position" themselves within a topic.

{% include figure.html src="/img/pulsar-reader-consumer-interfaces.png" alt="The Pulsar consumer and reader interfaces" width="80" %}

{% include admonition.html type="warning" title="Non-partitioned topics only"
content="The reader interface for Pulsar cannot currently be used with [partitioned topics](#partitioned-topics)." %}

Here's a Java example that begins reading from the earliest available message on a topic:

```java
import org.apache.pulsar.client.api.Message;
import org.apache.pulsar.client.api.MessageId;
import org.apache.pulsar.client.api.Reader;

String topic = "persistent://sample/standalone/ns1/reader-api-test";
MessageId id = MessageId.earliest;

// Create a reader on a topic and for a specific message (and onward)
Reader reader = pulsarClient.createReader(topic, id, new ReaderConfiguration());

while (true) {
    Message message = reader.readNext();

    // Process the message
}
```

To create a reader that will read from the latest available message:

```java
MessageId id = MessageId.latest;
Reader reader = pulsarClient.createReader(topic, id, new ReaderConfiguration());
```

To create a reader that will read from some message between earliest and latest:

```java
byte[] msgIdBytes = // Some byte array
MessageId id = MessageId.fromByteArray(msgIdBytes);
Reader reader = pulsarClient.createReader(topic, id, new ReaderConfiguration());
```
